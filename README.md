I am using Learn Python 3 the Hard Way (by Zed Shaw) as my study material to re-learn Python.

At the same time, I've recorded the process as "Study With Me" section in my YouTube channel. (Link: https://bit.ly/3msfpqV)

This was inspired by some senior Data Scientists who encouraged me to use whatever I've got to uplift people who are newer to data field.

No matter what level we're at >>> always room for contribution!

So! No matter where you are in Python, let's have fun learning :)
